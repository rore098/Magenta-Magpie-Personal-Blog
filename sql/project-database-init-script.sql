(1, '5 Great Alternatives to the Colour Magenta', '<p>If you''re a designer, chances are that at some point in your life you&rsquo;ve been tasked with creating something in the colour magenta. Whether it has been an advertisement or a website design, or perhaps even just a banner for your company''s social media account, there is no denying that it can be hard to find other colours which match well with this bright purple hue. But don''t worry! It doesn''t have to be difficult to find five colours that will go well with this shade of purple.</p>
<p>Here are our top picks: fuchsia, raspberry pink, deep violet, lavender and burgundy red. Which one do you like best?</p>
<p><strong>Fuchsia</strong></p>
<p>Fuchsia is a bright, warm colour that is similar in hue to magenta. It''s an energetic and fun shade that can be used well in many design projects. In addition, it can fit very well with a lot of other vibrant colours. This rich and dark purple has some similarities with magenta in terms of both hue and vibrancy. However, it has some blue undertones which really set it apart from this famously more purple shade.</p>
<p>This extremely dark red hue is almost closer to black than it is to any other colour. It''s another great alternative because of how different it is from the traditional purplish shades, but still has some similarity with magenta in terms of vibrancy and saturation.</p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Pink</strong></p>
<p>Another bright and warm colour, raspberry pink is just on the opposite side of the spectrum from magenta/fuchsia. It''s a great alternative to magenta as it feels just as strong and bold as this purple, but without being too similar in its shade or hue.</p>
<p>Paired with a bright, white background, raspberry pink is a great way to create a fun and colourful website design. It will also contrast magenta brilliantly while still looking professional.</p>
<p>Raspberry pink is the ideal substitute for the colour magenta if you are looking for something with an antique or vintage feel to it. This soft pink hue has been described by some as being ''dusty'' or ''dirty''.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Violet</strong></p>
<p>Deep violet is another alternative to the colour magenta which is cool in its effect. If you wanted to use purple but didn''t want something too bright, this would be a good choice.</p>
<p>Deep violet can easily go hand-in-hand with magenta. It is also described as being deep in comparison to lighter purples, so it stands out better than these alternatives when next to this same shade of purple.</p>
<p><strong>Lavender</strong></p>
<p>Lavender is similar in hue to lavender, which makes it another very relaxing shade of purple that works well with many other colours because of its subdued brightness.</p>
<p>Lavender can work well with magenta, despite typically being used alongside other shades like blue and green rather than purples. It is a soft shade that will work well if you want to use purple without going too far into the ''bright and bold'' territory.</p>
<p>If you''re looking for something more vibrant than lavender but not as bright as fuchsia or raspberry pink, this would be a good choice as its hue falls somewhere between these two colours on the spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>Burgundy Red</strong></p>
<p>Another thing that makes burgundy red such a good substitute for magenta is that it can sometimes appear pink rather than red.</p>
<p>Burgundy red has more blue than magenta, which makes it muted and darker than blonde hair dye and can therefore be used well when you want to use magenta without going too bright or bold.</p>
<p>Hope that these alternatives to the electric purple shade of magenta help you in your future design projects! By keeping in mind all of the different shades of purple around, it becomes much easier to find exactly what you''re looking for when trying to avoid this kind of colour clashing.</p>
<p>If there is one thing that can be said about this article, it''s that there are certainly plenty of other great alternative colours out there to the colour magenta. But perhaps the best suggestion would be consider sticking entirely to brown if you really need something which contrasts well with blonde hair dye! Now that''s a good idea... right? ;)</p>', 1, datetime('2021-09-01 02:19:46'), '5-Great-Alternatives-to-the-Colour-Magenta.jpg'),

(2, 'Five Strange Things You Didn''t Know About Magpies', '<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been in a field and heard the sound of a crow, then you know that they can be quite noisy. But if you&rsquo;re looking for something to really get your heart racing, there is nothing more terrifying than the call of the magpie. These black-and-white birds are known as &ldquo;the bringers of doom&rdquo; because their call was thought to predict death or disease. In fact, it turns out that these birds have five mysterious secrets about them which will make you think twice before going into a field again!</p>
<p><strong>1) Magpies are actually just crows with white feathers</strong></p>
<p>The magpie belongs to the same family as crows and ravens - Corvidae - and is no different from any other of its relatives. In fact, it&rsquo;s only the white colouration of the magpie that sets this bird apart - and even then, a scientist who wanted to study them would have to use maps and measurements of their distribution across the country rather than just a picture.</p>
<p><strong>2) Magpies can talk</strong></p>
<p>If you need an incentive to stay out of fields with magpies in, why not try thinking about this? The call they make sounds like &ldquo;a rusty gate&rdquo; if you want to put it bluntly (which may be why people believe such stories as those mentioned above). But their song is actually more complex than that! If you hang around long enough&mdash;and we mean a very long time&mdash;you can actually tell the different calls apart and even understand what they mean. The only problem is that magpies make about 20 different sounds, so we&rsquo;re still a long way off from being able to translate them all!</p>
<p><strong>3) Magpies have been living alongside us for longer than we think</strong></p>
<p>In days gone by, there were all kinds of tales about magpies being evil omens or harbingers of death. In fact, this bad reputation has been with them for over thousands of years. But it turns out our association with these birds was not always so negative... Magpies hardly ever attacked humans in the past &ndash; but times have changed. Today are known as something quite different: thieves! They wait until we''re not looking and then they&rsquo;ll take anything shiny or brightly colored that takes their fancy. It&rsquo;s no wonder farmers hate them so much when they steal the eggs from chickens nests and even, in some cases, break into people''s houses to steal rings and other jewels.</p>
<p><strong>4) Magpies mate for life</strong></p>
<p>Magpies will usually pair up with another magpie in their area and then move in together. Once a year in early summer they''ll build a nest together where they''ll raise their young, making them one of the few social birds which actually pull it off. The only problem is that if one of the pair dies&mdash;which happens quite often these days&mdash;the other one will most likely die of a broken heart.</p>
<p><strong>5) Magpies and crows love shiny stuff</strong></p>
<p>When they see bright and shiny objects, birds like magpies and crows can''t resist picking at them to find out what it is - even if it means breaking the item! It''s not just because they''re curious either; their beaks are actually magnetically sensitive which allows them to sense the magnetic forces that surround such objects. If you want to keep your belongings safe then it might be time for you to invest in a tin-foil hat...</p>
<p>So the next time you see a magpie in the field, don''t be too scared to go up and get a closer look - you might actually enjoy yourself!</p>', 2, datetime('2020-12-15 02:26:51'), 'Five-Strange-Things-You-Didnt-Know-About-Magpies.jpg'),

(1, '10 Reasons to Get a Magenta or a Magpie Tattoo', '<p>I am a passionate person, but on the other hand, I have this constant need to be accepted by everybody. That''s why I''m going to get a magenta or a magpie tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>1) To show my true colours</strong></p>
<p>Magentas and magpies are bright and vibrant colours that represent individuality and creativity. Did you know that 90% of tattoo parlours in the United States stock magenta or magpie ink? It''s true! There''s no need to go overseas anymore to get that perfect tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>2) To express myself</strong></p>
<p>The meaning behind tattoos is an expression of who you are as an individual - what better way than with colour?&nbsp; Magentas and magpies are a symbol of creativity, uniqueness and individuality. Tattoos are one way to express yourself. They are a symbol of uniqueness and individuality. With magenta or magpie tattoos you can look bright and vibrant.</p>
<p><strong>3) To feel special</strong></p>
<p>Getting your first tattoo can be an exhilarating experience because it feels like you''ve just made yourself part of something bigger than yourself. They also represent the desire to be free from restrictions. A lot of people have them on parts of their bodies that are easily covered, but others prefer to show them off by wearing very short skirts or shorts.</p>
<p>People with magenta or magpie tattoos always get noticed everywhere they go, because there''s only 1% of the population who has it! How many people do you think will notice your new bright colourful tattoo? It might sound like a weird idea, but if you want everybody to look at you wherever you go then this is perfect for you</p>
<p><strong>4) To own my body</strong></p>
<p>In our society, we often take ownership over things (e.g., cars, homes, clothes) that are seen as extensions of ourselves. However, we can''t take ownership of our bodies because they belong to everyone else. As long as your body is public property, you might as well decorate it yourself in a way that expresses who you truly are.</p>
<p><strong>5) To express my emotions</strong></p>
<p>The colour magenta represents happiness and joy while the colour purple symbolizes compassion and love - all things I need in this world. And magpies are a symbol of luck and happiness!</p>
<p><strong>6) Because magenta looks good with everything</strong></p>
<p>Magenta or magpie tattoos look great with both feminine outfits (e.g., skinny jeans, blouses) and masculine ones (e.g., leather jackets).&nbsp; It goes great on any skin tone, so it can be worn by both men and women. Wear them with pride!</p>
<p><strong>7) To celebrate individuality</strong></p>
<p>Individuality is about thinking for yourself instead of following the crowd or doing what everybody else does. This tattoo expresses that you are an individual who has his or her own thoughts, feelings, ideas, opinions, traditions, tastes etc. It represents being different from most others - in a good way! Most people will never understand this because they''re too afraid to stand out which is why magenta or magpie tattoos are perfect for you!</p>
<p><strong>8) To stop being so indecisive</strong></p>
<p>This one is really important - I can''t keep changing my mind about things that will have to stay with me for the rest of my life.&nbsp; I''m sick of changing my mind and making decisions over and over again. I can''t make up my mind about what clothes to wear, what coffee shop I should get a mocha from or even which flavour mocha I want in the morning!</p>
<p><strong>9) To be more creative</strong></p>
<p>When you''re too busy worrying about the placement of your tattoo, it takes away from your actual creativity and ability to focus on what you want to do in life.&nbsp; Magenta or magpie tattoos are inspired by individual creativity. People with this tattoo are always very creative, thoughtful and original thinkers!</p>
<p><strong>10) Because birds are cute</strong></p>
<p>All right, this isn''t a reason, but I don''t care because magenta magpies are the cutest!</p>
<p>You should get a magenta or magpie tattoo because it''s the coolest thing that you''ve ever done. They''re absolutely stunning to look at, they make you smile every time you see one, and everyone will be green with envy when they see your new ink!&nbsp; This is one of the best decisions anyone can make - trust me, don''t think about it anymore! Go for it!</p>
<p>REMEMBER: When deciding on your next piece of body art, choose wisely because tattoos are forever. You can never change what you get inked onto your skin!</p>', 4, datetime('2020-02-14 02:26:34'), '10-Reasons-to-Get-a-Magenta-or-a-Magpie-Tattoo.jpg'),

(2, 'How to Tell a Magpie From a Crow' ,'<p>Magpies are one of the most fascinating creatures in the world. They have so many features that make them amazing! One way you can tell if it''s a magpie or crow is by looking at their feathers under magnification. Magpies'' feathers are thicker and more rounded, while crows'' are thinner and pointer, just like needles! There are also other ways to tell which bird is what, but this is one of the easiest methods. You should take notes on these differences because they could come in handy someday!</p>
<p><strong>What are the differences between magpies and crows?</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways to tell the difference between a magpie and a crow. One easy way is by listening to their song because the sound of a magpie''s call is higher-pitched than that of a similarly sized crow, which has a deeper croak. Another method is looking at their feathers under magnification.</p>
<p>In addition, both birds have different eye shapes: Magpies have larger eyes that are more circular in shape while crows'' eyes are smaller and more triangular-shaped. Finally, magpies tend to be lighter coloured whereas crows usually appear darker brown or black in colouration.</p>
<p><strong>How can you tell what type of bird you''re looking at?</strong></p>
<p>This is a question that people who like birds often ask themselves. The most common method of identifying a bird is by its song, but what if you don''t know the bird''s song? Another way of telling whether it''s a magpie or a crow is to look at their feathers under magnification. Magpies'' feathers are thicker and more rounded, while crows'' are thinner and pointer, just like needles! There are also other ways to tell which bird is what, but this is one of the easiest methods.</p>
<p><strong>What should you do if one lands on your property?</strong></p>
<p>If you are the proud owner of a home or property, you might have one day welcomed your new pet into your yard by feeding it. Little did you know that this magpie or crow could be dangerous! If you''ve found yourself in this situation, never approach the bird with an umbrella because the bird will see the umbrella as a threat. Stay away from cats too because both animals can hurt each other if they feel threatened! Also, crows and magpies aren''t used to being around humans so don''t try to handle them unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any other ways to tell them apart?</strong></p>
<p>In addition, both birds have different eye shapes: Magpies have larger eyes that are more circular in shape while crows'' eyes are smaller and more triangular-shaped. Finally, magpies tend to be lighter coloured whereas crows usually appear darker brown or black in colouration.</p>
<p>Both these birds eat insects, especially during the breeding season, along with nuts and seeds such as oats or corn. They also feed on worms or ants when they go looking for food a second time at night.</p>
<p>If you''re a bird lover, it''s important to know how to differentiate between a magpie and a crow because they can both be dangerous creatures. The best way is by looking at their feathers under magnification or listening carefully for the different sounds of their call. If that doesn''t work, just keep in mind these differences: Magpies have large eyes with round pupils while crows'' are smaller with triangular-shaped pupils; magpies usually appear lighter coloured than crows who tend to look darker brown or black; and finally, magpies feed on insects whereas crows eat more varied food such as worms and oats/corn during the breeding season.</p>', 3, datetime('now') ,'How-to-Tell-a-Magpie-From-a-Crow.jpg'),

(1, 'The History and Use of Magenta in Modern Times', '<p>The history of magenta is not widely known, but its creation opened doors for future innovators to take the colour wheel even further. Now what was once thought of as a "lost" or forgotten colour has made its way into everyday life and pop culture.</p>
<p><strong>What does Magenta mean?</strong></p>
<p>Magenta is the first truly modern synthetic organic colour because it was created by chemists rather than dyes derived from living organisms. It also helped pave the way for other colours like pyrrole red (a type of red), Palatinate Purple (another version of purple) and others.</p>
<p><strong>Where does Magenta come from?</strong></p>
<p>And why might it be called something else? There are several types of magenta including 1-methoxy-2-naphthol, pigment scarlet 4R, 2-[(1-methoxy-2-naphthyl)azo]-1-(p-tolyl)-3 -pyrazolidone or pigment red 122. One of the most common and easiest to use is Pigment Red 122, which is also known as Magenta for its deep shade and vibrance.</p>
<p><strong>What else has magenta been used in?</strong></p>
<p>Magenta was first discovered by accident in 1859 when chemist Jean Baptiste Guimet combined an organic red dye called Pararosaniline (or rosaniline) with Potassium dichromate. His experiments were documented in a thesis after which he shared his findings with other chemists. It was later used to dye silk and the first printed colour advertisements known as colour cards were printed using magenta.</p>
<p><strong>What can you find Magenta in?</strong></p>
<p>Magenta is seen everywhere ranging from clothing, food, art and adverts.</p>
<p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>
<p>Fashion designer Tom Ford released his own lipstick shade called ''Shameless Scarlet'' which was vibrant fuchsia pink inspired by actress Jessica Chastain. He also named it after her because he thought she wore the colour so well.</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong></p>
<p>Jane''s Addiction frontman Perry Farrell has an entire line of wine called "Mod Cerise" (French for "Cherry Mod") that is made up of bright cerise tones; tangerine, grapefruit, bing cherry, pink grapefruit and vanilla.</p>
<p><strong>Art</strong></p>
<p>Magenta has been used by some of the most influential artists in history. The painting ''Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog'' by Casper David Friedrich uses pyrrole red while Mark Rothko used both phthalocyanine green or blue, liquid yellow lemon, liquid light orange, liquid light magenta, alizarin crimson lake extra, phthalocyanine blue, anthraquinone violets lake extra, indanthrone blue, benzimidazolone gold, quinacridone rose and permanent green light.</p>
<p><strong>What is the colour magenta really about?</strong></p>
<p>The colour makes you think of ripe fruits like cherries which are also deep shades of red like Magenta. It''s also associated with the colour pink which is often associated with femininity.</p>
<p><strong>Why was it used in printing?</strong></p>
<p>One of the first printed colour advertisements known as color cards were printed using magenta. Manufacturers began to create fabrics dyed with magenta, scarlet and other bright hues like green to help their products stand out on crowded shelves.</p>
<p><strong>How has it evolved over time?</strong></p>
<p>There are multiple variations of Magenta that can be created especially through digital methods; including Vibrant Pink , Deep Pink, Radiant Fuchsia, Hot Magenta, Ultra Red. Some shades are brighter than others so you''ll notice different tones throughout fashion, clothing, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean about our culture?</strong></p>
<p>Magenta is a reflection of what we feel and who we are. The vibrant, fiery colour gives us confidence while also meaning innocence or youthful exuberance. It''s a popular choice for parents to help their babies express themselves through clothing because it''s not too loud nor is it boring yet very distinctive.</p>
<p>The history behind magenta makes it clear how this colour has evolved over time while still maintaining its original meaning; making us think about who we are and what we feel inside.</p>', 5, datetime('2021-08-14 02:25:22'), 'The-History-and-Use-of-Magenta-in-Modern-Times.jpg'),

(2, 'Why Do We Talk About Seeing a Magpie at Work?', '<p>Magpies are a symbol of death and bad luck, right? Wrong! In this article, we''ll explore the history of the superstition that if you see a magpie while working, it''s going to be your last day on the job. We''ll also look at some research on how seeing a magpie can actually bring good luck. Let''s get started!</p>
<p>I''ve been working in my office for years now and have never seen a magpie anywhere near me or my workplace. But I''ve read about this superstition many times before so yesterday when I left work early because I had a headache, I made sure to take one last glance around just in case there was an iridescent bird perched nearby. Sure enough, two seconds later I spotted a magpie. Did I get my marching orders? No, surprisingly enough my boss didn''t give me the old heave-ho! But is this a fluke or was she genuinely happy to see me going?</p>
<p>This superstition has been around for centuries and one of the earliest recorded references comes from 1486 when Reginald Peacock wrote: "If you tarry ''til you see, A pye [magpie] upon yonder tree, You need not fear but your master will be good." But what''s strange is that seeing magpies were originally seen as symbols of bad luck - so why did someone decide to turn it upside down? Do any experts know? Actually yes! There are several different theories as to how this superstition came about.</p>
<p>For example, some historians believe it''s because magpies were seen as a symbol of evil omens and would be seen as an omen of doom to those seeing them at work. Others think it all comes from ancient Greece where farmers would kill magpies believing that they harm the fertility of the land and crops that grow on it! However, others believe there''s a hidden message within all this that going for a walk will keep you healthy - which sounds crazy but is true!</p>
<p>But hold on a minute! I''ve never heard anything about going for a walk before? Yes well apparently if you go outside and see two or more magpies then it''s considered good luck. Before I go any further, let''s take a look at some research and see if we can learn anything about seeing magpies in the wild.</p>
<p><strong>What does the research say?</strong></p>
<p>There is plenty of scientific research out there that shows how animals might not be as bad for our health as we believe. For example, researchers from the University of Exeter found that having pets such as dogs and cats help to reduce stress levels in patients who suffer from depression and anxiety. Another study showed that even just looking at cute animal pictures reduces your cortisol levels when placed under stress! So next time you''re feeling stressed why not watch a few videos of puppies playing on YouTube? It might help more than you think! But back to the topic in hand, does seeing magpies really bring good luck?</p>
<p>Well according to the folklore, yes it does! This is because if you see a single magpie then that''s considered unlucky but take a look at two of them and you''re in for some good fortune. But how do we know this? Well if you check out this article on Okehampton Camp you''ll find out how during WW1 an army regiment was stationed there and started hunting magpies to bring them down. Luckily for us, however, they stopped without any casualties so no one was injured yet someone still created an urban myth around the event - which to me sounds like something out of Blackadder Goes Forth!</p>
<p>Another story comes from Manchester where workers would open up a new factory each day. Whenever they heard the chimes of Big Ben, it meant that it was time for them to leave their jobs and look for some magpies - screaming if they found one! But this might be another urban legend because no one has managed to verify this story... yet.</p>
<p><strong>When does this superstition come into play?</strong></p>
<p>The idea is that seeing a single magpie will lead to bad news soon after, but seeing two means you''re in for some great fortune instead. So whenever you see multiple magpies then consider yourself lucky! This includes if you see one magpie while you''re out on a walk or even if you spot one in the wild while taking pictures of wildlife. But was this legend all just hearsay? Or can we actually find any scientific evidence to back it up?</p>
<p>After doing some extensive research online I was surprised that there''s very little evidence to suggest that seeing magpies actually brings good luck - which goes against popular belief. However, after reading through some forums and websites I did manage to come across someone who had personally experienced this superstition for themselves! But before I go into more detail about their story, let''s quickly address some research surrounding animals...</p>
<p><strong>So is there any link between animals and humans health-wise?</strong></p>
<p>Researchers have found time and time again that animals are good for our health and well-being. For example, one study found that people who own pets like cats or dogs could actually live longer than those who don''t because of how they interact with them. The other main reason why seeing magpies brings good fortune is because it means you''ll be healthy soon after - but does this have any scientific links?</p>
<p>Well, I can''t find anything to support this claim but there are numerous studies out there that show us the positive effects pets have on our health. But what about wild animals? What research can we find to back up their benefits to human beings?</p>
<p>Although researchers haven''t found a direct link between seeing magpies and being healthier, there are plenty of academic articles which do back up how we can benefit from seeing most types of wildlife. This includes birds, for example, as one study showed that they play an important role in helping to reduce the number of pests and keep ecosystems healthy. So next time you see a bird or even a magpie while out and about, consider it lucky!</p>
<p>Another superstition which might explain why we talk about seeing magpies is because they can be carrion-eaters - so whenever we see them then it''s possible that someone nearby could have just died! But perhaps there''s another reason as to why this legend came into existence? Let''s now take a look at stories involving magpies...</p>
<p>A few months ago I had my own experience with this superstition, but I didn''t get fired...</p>
<p>I was working in a factory at the time and sometimes we would come across magpies. But hearing them usually meant that it was going to rain - especially if they whistled! The weather forecast proved this theory right, so whenever we heard one then everyone began to run for cover. This only started because someone got struck by lightning while outside which lead us to believe that there must be a link between seeing a magpie and being hit by lightning. But is this actually true?</p>
<p>In fact, although seeing a bird bring bad luck isn''t scientifically proven, scientists have been looking into how animals can predict earthquakes . For example, certain animals such as dogs seem to behave differently before tremors take place and cause concern among those who own them. We also know that other animals have been seen acting erratically just before earthquakes because of how they move their bodies. The only difference between a magpie and a dog, however, is that there doesn''t seem to be any documented cases linking seeing a magpie with being hit by lightning - which might explain why this superstition has died down.</p>
<p>Possible conclusion: 1) Seeing one magpie isn''t going to bring bad luck to you as long as nothing else happens shortly after... 2) But if you see more than one bird then it''s possible that good fortune will follow shortly after... 3) There isn''t enough evidence to suggest that seeing birds brings good health to us or even predicts earthquakes...</p>', 3, datetime('2021-07-08 22:07:43'), 'Why Do We Talk About Seeing a Magpie at Work.jpg'),

(1, 'What Makes the Magenta Colour Scheme Work?', '<p>The magenta colour scheme is a mix of red and violet on the colour wheel. It&rsquo;s said to evoke feelings such as warmth, energy, playfulness, creativity and love.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a colour scheme to use for your company or business logo-magenta might be something to consider! Here''s some more information about what makes it work:</p>
<p><strong>Warmth </strong></p>
<p>Magenta is a warm colour. According to Color Wheel Pro, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the most energetic of all colours" because it is "neither cool nor warm." This makes it great for evoking feelings that are neither too serious nor too relaxed.</p>
<p>Colours that are similar to magenta in this way include red-violet, pink and burgundy. These hues can be used to give warmth to an image or product design which could evoke feelings of love, playfulness or creativity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned above, magenta can also be used as an alternative to red if you are looking for a more feminine colour scheme. It is said that people perceive the colour pink as being warmer than red, even though most people see it as a cooler colour.</p>
<p><strong>Energetic </strong></p>
<p>According to Cool Moose, "Magenta is the colour used by all artists who want to evoke excitement and enthusiasm." This makes sense when you consider that magenta is a mix between red and violet on the colour wheel-two very intense colours.</p>
<p>Dominant hues in your image or logo design can help communicate energy. Magenta is often used along with other bright colours such as yellow and cyan to create high-impact designs. It can be used alternative with pink for a softer feminine look.</p>
<p>A great example of this is the Spotify play button, which has been designed as a combination of magenta and green: two complementary colours.</p>
<p><strong>Creativity </strong></p>
<p>Cool Moose also mentions that "Magenta is the colour of creativity." This may be due to magenta being a mix between red and violet, two hues that are associated with passion and purpose. Magenta has even been used as the official colour of creativity by Adobe Systems because it "reminds us that every great idea comes from thinking outside the box."</p>
<p>This combination could be very useful for designers who are looking for a way to communicate energy without using too much yellow. For example, you could use this color scheme for your business logo if you''re in a creative industry like IT or music: both fields where having an active imagination and taking risks is key to success. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also explore this idea in your image and product design by using a dominant magenta hue to represent energy, warmth, creativity or playfulness.</p>
<p><strong>Love </strong></p>
<p>Last but not least, the magenta colour scheme is thought to be associated with love. According to Cool Moose, "People are more relaxed around magenta." This makes it an excellent alternative for red if you are looking for a less competitive or aggressive feel.</p>
<p>The fact that it is made up of two conflicting colours also gives it a playful appeal which could help communicate affection for your audience. For example, baby pink has been shown to have calming properties so it would be perfect for use in marketing campaigns targeting children-especially young girls-or family-related businesses or products.</p>
<p>To conclude, magenta is a great alternative if you are looking for an energetic, but not too aggressive colour scheme. It can be used to evoke feelings of creativity or love and it can also be combined with other hues like pink or cyan to create high-impact designs. &nbsp;The next time you''re designing your company logo, consider magenta as one of the colours in your palette!</p>', 3, datetime('2021-06-07 03:25:37'), 'What-Makes-the-Magenta-Colour-Scheme-Work.jpg'),

(2, 'How Can I Protect My Yard From a Magpie Attack?', '<p>Some people can''t help but feel a sense of dread when they see one of these birds perched on their patio. Others might not think that the magpie is all that bad, and just need to know how to keep them away from your yard.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to teach you about the magpies'' habits so you can better protect yourself against them. I''ll also talk about some things you can do if you want to try getting rid of your unwanted visitors for good.</p>
<p>Magpies are some of the most intelligent birds on the planet. They can recognize faces, and some people even think they learn to recognize how much effort you put into scaring them away. It might take them several weeks to start coming back, but don''t lose heart because they will eventually come back.</p>
<p>The magpie is known for its aggressive behaviour where it gets all up in your personal space and encounters little resistance from you, so it keeps doing it more often than not. This happens because humans tend to under-react when it comes to unwelcome confrontations with animals that might lead to an attack, which just encourages the animal''s inappropriate behaviours.</p>
<p>When confronted by this bird, whether it''s perched on your property or trying to poke a beak in your garbage can, always wave your arms and yell at it to indicate you mean business. If the magpie doesn''t get scared away by this point, you should try throwing out something like an empty soda bottle filled with pebbles. This will make enough noise that not only will scare them away but also tell other birds that might think about coming here next time there''s trouble.</p>
<p>If the magpies are getting brave and starting to come around during broad daylight, turn on all of your outdoor lights so they''ll never know what hit them when you go outside with whatever weapon you have on hand. You can also place an owl statue or bird feeder near where the magpies usually hang out. The statue or feeder should be strategically placed so the birds will stare right into it when they try to land in that spot.</p>
<p>If you''re trying to get rid of these birds for good, then there are a few things you can do. It''s probably not very practical to put up an electric fence around your yard, so what most people usually do is string some aluminium pie pans along their fences. The magpies hate the sound the pies make when the wind blows, so they won''t come near your house if they see them. Another thing you can try is tying mylar balloons at ankle height on either side of every entry point where the magpies like to enter and exit your property. These balloons will scare them away just as well as the aluminium pans do.</p>
<p>If you''re concerned for the safety of your pets, then perhaps you should consider keeping them indoors when they''re outside. You can also keep your trashcan inside with a magpie locking lid on it so it''s harder for them to get in and out.</p>
<p>For those whose problem is more severe than just a few birds every now and then, there are companies that have years of experience with humane bird control. If you don''t want to hurt these animals but you want them gone from your property, one of those companies will be able to help by removing them safely from wherever they''re making a nuisance.</p>', 3, datetime('2020-03-30 14:11:25'), 'How-Can-I-Protect-My-Yard-From-a-Magpie-Attack.jpg'),

(2, 'Is it OK to eat magpie meat?', '<p>This article will explore the question of whether or not it is OK to eat magpie meat. Eating magpies, also known as pies, has been a part of many different cultures for centuries. Magpies are found all over the world and they are usually consumed in ways that vary from region to region. Some people claim that you can tell if someone is "sweet" by how much they like eating pie. However, some people do not believe it is safe to consume them at all due to their high lead levels which result from their diet of small animals such as rodents and bugs. The truth about this issue may be more complicated than we think though because there have been conflicting studies done on both sides of this debate with no clear answer in sight.</p>
<h2>Environmental Factors</h2>
<p>The environmental factors have played a major role in the studies done on this topic. For example, one study done in Poland showed that the lead levels of pie showed high correlations to the environment they were raised in. A lot of these bugs contain high amounts of lead which they eat and then are then eaten by the pie who absorbs the lead into their systems. However, another study done in Norway showed that pies had low levels of lead in their systems when compared to other wildlife which contradicts this theory.</p>
<h2>It Is Ethical to Eat Magpies</h2>
<p>According to the book "Eating on the Wild Side" by Jo Robinson, magpies are not just safe to eat but they are also high in protein and low in fat. [1] Everyone knows that meat is high in protein due it being an animal product, but most people do not know that plants such as kale and spinach also have protein. It is even possible that the common belief that you need meat to consume protein is incorrect and therefore magpie meat would be an excellent choice for vegetarians. According to the World Health Organization, protein deficiencies are common in developing countries where malnutrition kills more than 3 million children each year. [2] Therefore it may not be horrifically unethical to eat magpies if there is no other option for obtaining protein in these areas of the world. On top of their already healthy nutritional value, wild game such as magpies, rabbits, deer, pheasants, ducks and geese contain much less fat compared to animals raised on farms. "We recommend lean or low-fat meats but there''s an easy way".</p>', 2, datetime('2021-11-05 04:44:53'), 'Is it OK to eat magpie meat.jpg'),

(2, 'The Angry Magpie', '<p>"The Angry Magpie" was a ballad that my father used to sing to me when I was a child. He said that the magpie in this song is angry because his songs were never heard by others and only served as background noise. The magpie does not like his songs because they do not bring him joy and he doesn''t want other birds to experience this feeling. This made me sad when I first heard this story, but over time I learned to be grateful for all of my listeners and listeners-to-be who will never hear this song without my telling them about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ballad is about a magpie who doesn''t like his songs. He decides to go out into the world and sing the same song over and over again in front of other creatures. The poor bird''s aim is to make all of them (and himself) miserable with his incessant, monotonous cries for attention. However, while he does succeed in making everyone else annoyed, they are still oblivious to his presence--all except for one girl who eventually teaches him how important it is to make others happy with your songs by not singing yourself. I think that my father used this story as an analogy for human relationships because he would only sing the first verse and the chorus part of the song otherwise it would get very repetitive.</p>
<p>The lyrics are as follows:</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, my father used to sing this song for me because he said that it reminded him of me. Now that I''m older, I wonder if the angry magpie''s sentiments about his songs remind him of himself because he never appreciated how hard I worked to make him happy with my singing. And now, perhaps it is too late to apologize for all the selfish thoughts and actions I''ve had throughout our lives together.</p>
<p>My childhood home was very secluded from any other families, so much so that we could not hear any other children playing outside except on sunny days. The closest house where another family lived was at least an acre away (the separating us wasn''t really measured by distance). Our house was surrounded by trees on all sides. There were plenty of children who had previously lived in our neighborhood, but they moved away quickly because of the darkness that seemed to overtake the air around us.</p>
<p>There''s a lot I could blame my father for, some more serious than others. However, one thing is certain; he was always interested in what I would sing and how I sang it (with an emphasis on "it"). He told me stories like this one over and over again until they stuck with me even when I didn''t want them to be remembered anymore. If you asked him about my childhood now, he would say that he wanted me to have music wherever I went--not inside any room or building but in my heart and soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the magpie begins its singing, an old woman is very annoyed with it and says "O I''m not going to stand this any longer! Here''s a shovel full of ashes; spread them over your back and be done with you!" She goes on to say that she''ll feed him to the pigs if he doesn''t stop his noise, but the magpie continues anyway. An old man tells him to keep quiet as well, but this does not help either. The next morning, when all of the birds are flying around for food they see that one of their own has been covered in ashes from head to toe. They think that he was attacked by some larger and hurry home to tell their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The magpie went to see the old man and ask him what happened, but he gets no answer. The magpie goes to the old woman''s house and asks her what had happened and she says that he''d angered her greatly with his singing, so she took out a shovel full of ashes and threw it all over his back. After this discussion, both old people jump into their beds and cover themselves up in sheets pretending that they''re dead just because this one bird came by to talk to them for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when other birds come home from foraging for food or building nests, they spot the covered-in-ashes magpie who falls down in front of them (he was too tired from his flight to avoid the fall). The magpies rush home and tell their wives and children what they''ve seen and that he must be dead. Once this has reached the ears of the old woman and man, they step outside their houses to see what all the fuss was about. They notice that the ashes have been knocked off of him, which makes them decide to cover themselves in cinders (since it''ll appear as though they died for real). The birds go away again only to return once more with news of another covered-in-ashes magpie near by. This time, both of them jump into a barrel full of water, but after a while they come out because no one is there anymore.</p>
<p>The main conflict in this story is between the old woman, the old man, and the magpie. The old woman doesn''t want to hear his singing anymore while the old man stays quite while he''s present, so he decides it best to leave. It is never mentioned if everything goes back to normal after this point in time.</p>', 5, datetime('2021-11-05 06:08:20'), 'The Angry Magpie.jpg'),

In the article "10 Things Your Lipstick is Telling You" by Dr. Anjali Mahto , she points out that magenta lipstick shades are often worn by young women (especially teenage girls), although there are many exceptions when it comes to certain celebrities who prefer this shade of lipstick.</p>

When a woman wears a bright shade of lip stick it can give off the impression that she is more sexually available, especially if the color is red. at heart; "I''m not sexy or glamorous. I''m like...serious and dull. But I do want to have a good time, and it''s okay if that makes me look like a weirdo."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the article "What Your Lipstick Says About You" by Allure Magazine, it was explained that studies show red lipstick make women appear more assertive and confident in their ability. This is because of how reds are associated with passion, sexiness, power, confidence, and defiance.</p>
<p>When the color magenta is applied to one''s lips it has been seen as an act of rebellion against traditional gender roles which include staying quiet about your thoughts/opinions. Magenta lipsticks on social media platforms such as Twitter attract attention within feminist communities on social media.</p>

<h2>Magpie Recipes</h2>

<li><strong>Roasted Magpie</strong> &ndash; Preheat your oven or grill to 170&deg;C (325&deg;F). Wash and clean your magpies thoroughly. Cut off their heads, legs, wings and other unwanted parts.

(1, 'Ways to use the color magenta in your home', '<p>The color magenta is a fascinating color. It''s a combination of the colors violet and red, two colors which are opposite on the color wheel. Magenta can be used to create soothing or energetic feelings, depending on its shade. The darker shades will usually have more energy while lighter shades will have more calming effects.</p>
<p>In this post we''ll cover some ways you can use magenta in your home decorating scheme. First let''s start with an easy way: pillows! There are plenty of variations out there for magenta pillows; from simple solid colors to complex patterns and prints like paisley and damask designs. If you want something even simpler than that, try using a traditional white pillowcase with a piece of fabric that matches your d&eacute;cor on top.</p>
<p>Another simple way to use magenta in your home is by painting one wall of a room. This can be either the walls facing each other if you have an open floor plan, or the back wall of the room you are decorating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could also try painting some cabinets or cupboards in magenta instead of black, white, grey or rustic browns . It''s bright enough that it will create a good contrast with dark colors while being interesting enough without becoming too distracting. If you''re really looking for something bold then why not paint all your appliances magenta? A stove, fridge and dishwasher can liven up any kitchen or dining area!</p>
<p>For another bold design move, you could paint the floor in your living room magenta! This is a design trick that has been used by interior designers for decades. Sometimes it can be hard to decorate around large pieces of furniture like couches, chairs and cabinets; painting the floor creates the illusion that they are not there, allowing your imagination to be free while at the same time creating bold focal points.</p>
<p>Finally let''s mention one more way to use magenta in your home. You may have seen this technique before; sewing contrasting fabric strips on either side of your couch or some other seating area... if you haven''t done this already then try it out some time. It works really well with red, green or black fabrics but can also look good with more muted colors like beige, taupe or white.</p>

(2, 'Magpie Recipe Ideas', '<p>Magpies are not the most popular birds, but they may be among the smartest. Recent research shows that magpies can understand cause-and-effect relationships and anticipate future events based on past experience. When they see a person hide food in one location, for example, they know it''s likely to happen again in another location.</p>
<p>This makes them ideal companions for cooks who need help keeping track of what needs to go into the oven next or how much time is left until dinner is ready!</p>
<p>It also means that it pays to take care when you''re cooking with magpies around! They''ll notice if you accidentally leave something out of your recipe or forget an important step in preparing your dish. If you want to keep them from messing up your cooking, here are some ideas:</p>
<p>- Magpies can''t taste anything, so they don''t care if their food is spicy. If you''ve tried a dish with magpie and found it''s too spicy for your tastes, try adding more of the foods you commonly cook with to balance out the flavor.</p>
<p>- If you want to give one of them a healthy snack but don''t know how it will go over, ask if they''d like a sample before feeding them an entire meal! Also, see what types of berries or nuts they might be interested in collecting. Letting them know that certain plants are poisonous may cause problems - they''ll avoid those plants and never find out which ones make good snacks.</p>
<p>Magpies are also very curious. If you''re trying to keep one out of your kitchen, be sure to put locks on all the cabinets and drawers! They''ll check them all if they can, so make sure nothing is left open by mistake.</p>
<p>- Do not leave any food outside where it might attract magpies.</p>
<p>- Ensure that no magpie can sneak up behind you or trap you in a corner - they may try to take advantage of your distraction by stealing something. If necessary, pick up small objects like utensils before cooking with magpies around.</p>
<p>- Magpies can open jars and cans easily, even without opposable thumbs. these types of containers well away from where you''re cooking to avoid any accidents.</p>
<p>- Magpies may try to eat things that aren''t food! Keep a close eye on them and enforce safe eating habits if they get into your chemicals/medicine cabinet, toiletries, etc.</p>
<p>- If you''re near a body of water such as a river or ocean, feed the magpie something substantial before heading in - they might decide to go fishing with their bare hands! This can be entertaining for both of you, but could lead to dangerous situations.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to handle these types of problems, it''s time for some recipe ideas:</p>
<p>1) Spicy Potatoes and Maggot Stew:&nbsp;&nbsp; (potatoes, butter) + (nightcrawler, salt)</p>
<p>2) Sweet Magpie Pie: (handful of mixed dried berries, pie crust) + (magpie, cinnamon)</p>
<p>3) Magpie Mac&amp;Cheese: (fresh maggots in the garden, butter knife to scrape them off, macaroni noodles; boiling water; cheese slices; + maggie(s))</p>
<p>4) Tree Rat Surprise (tree rat fillets in foil with lemon juice and chopped vegetables like carrots or potatoes), + two or more magpies. Tip: If you want to be sure it''s safe to eat before letting your magpies try it, make tree rat surprise for yourself first! This dish is very healthy and has a lot of protein - if your magpies eat it up, they must have liked it.</p>
<p>See? Cooking with Magpies isn''t so hard! Keeping them out of the kitchen is a little harder though - good luck and happy cooking!</p>

(1, 'Is there such thing as a fetish with the color magenta?', '<p>Is there such thing as a fetish with the color magenta? I don''t know. But, I can tell you that if there is, then this blog post might be just for them!</p>
<p>I''m not sure whether or not it''s possible to have a "magenta fetish", but now that the question has been posed...it seems like an interesting topic to explore. If you do happen to have one of these rare fetishes, then please feel free to share your thoughts in the comment section below!</p>
<p>I''m going to take a bit of an artistic approach for this blog post, where I''ll explore the various uses and meanings associated with the color magenta.</p>
<p><strong>The "Crayola" Color Magenta!</strong></p>
<p>A little background on how this subject came to my attention...</p>
<p>During my research for yesterday''s post about how to wear red lipstick, I stumbled upon a site that listed all the different color names used in crayons. When I saw "magenta", it caught my eye because when you hear the word "magenta", many think of purple. In reality however, magenta is a pinkish-red hue that is commonly associated with pinks and purples in crayons. If you look at the picture above, it''s easy to see that there''s hardly any difference between magenta and purple!</p>
<p><strong>A Little Bit of History...</strong></p>
<p>As with most colors, magenta wasn''t always just a color in crayons! Like red-violet (magenta), this color was known as "fuschine" at one point in time. Originally, Fuschine&mdash;a dye extracted from lichen&mdash;was discovered around 1859 by an Italian chemist who named the substance after his homeland of Fusch, Austria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before its discovery as a dyestuff (the definition of which is simply "...substances that can be used for dyeing"), Fuschine was commonly used in medicines and cosmetics. But, once chemists created synthetic dyes during the late 1800''s...Fuschine began to lose its popularity as a dye. (However, it still gained some notoriety because of the fact that Fuschine could be easily obtained from lichen).</p>
<p><strong>The Color Magenta Today!</strong></p>
<p>Today, magenta is still widely used in medicine and cosmetics; but, there are very few commercial uses for this color due to the fact that so many artificial dyes exist today. Thusly, today people use "magenta" when referring to anything with slight reddish-purplish undertones&mdash;just like what you see in crayons. In modern times, the word "magenta" isn''t often used to describe a color...but when it is, you can trust that it''s quite close to being a purplish-red shade!</p>
<p><strong>The Color Magenta in Popular Culture</strong></p>
<p>Most people know that in pop culture, magenta is usually associated with purple. But have you ever heard of a song called "Magenta?" Well if you haven''t I''m going to tell you about it anyway! Released back in 1984 as part of an album by David Bowie, "Magenta" describes something as being "...like an animal." In other words, magenta suggests something primal and untamed&mdash;something dangerous but fascinating at the same time. However, this is somewhat ironic because magenta isn''t typically associated with danger...</p>
<p><strong>Types of Magenta!</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of what the color "magenta" means today, let''s look at other shades related to it. Keep in mind, there are plenty of different variations of magenta for you to choose from&mdash;some being very light and others being quite dark.</p>
<p><strong>What Colors Go Well With Magenta?</strong></p>
<p>Just like most other colors, purple compliments magenta nicely! However, I think that pink goes even better with magenta than purple does! So if you''re ever shopping for makeup or clothes...or if you''re simply looking for something new to put on your walls, don''t be afraid to experiment with different shades of magenta.</p>
<p><strong>Magenta (Music)</strong></p>
<p>Today, all types of music genres use magenta when describing something that''s considered very hip or in-style. For example, when people say that a certain type of dance music is "very magenta," they''re basically saying that it sounds really good! (Of course, this isn''t necessarily true in every caseIs there such thing as a fetish with the color magenta?</p>', 4, datetime('2021-11-05 05:39:47'), 'Is there such thing as a fetish with the color magenta.jpg'),

(2, 'What should you do if a magpie attacks?', '<p>Do you know what to do if a magpie attacks? The answer may astound you. It&rsquo;s not as simple as it seems. In fact, the best course of action is often counterintuitive.</p>
<p>What should I do if a magpie attacks me? Does this sound like an annoying joke that someone made up just to annoy people who are afraid of birds? Well, bird expert David FitzSimmons would tell you otherwise: &ldquo;If a bird hits you, there''s no need to panic or try and shoo it away." He goes on to explain that "most birds will fly off after they''ve hit somebody" and that "they''re usually only trying to protect their nest." So next time one of these little demons honks into you, just chill and let it be. It knows what it does.</p>
<p>Difficult as it may seem, we must implore you: Do not run after the bird with your arms flapping frantically. If they are still attacking an hour later, they are most likely nesting nearby . At this point, making a large amount of noise getting away is best advised. Make sure that you don''t have any food with you at all times to avoid further attacks during this time! This includes pockets! With these tips in mind, Australia''s magpie population will be kept under control for years to come!</p>
<p>Still unsure about what to do if a magpie attacks? See below for further information about my personal experiences with these diabolical birds.</p>
<p>I remember this one time when I was just minding my own business, walking along the street on my way to work. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, this godawful squawking sound assaults my ears as something crashes directly into me. The pain is incredible! My body is wracked with agony! I think it''s safe to say that this horrible incident would have killed most other people - but not tough ol'' Davey Whelan here! After the searing pain subsided enough for me to catch my breath, I realized that all the commotion had attracted quite an audience. People were clapping and cheering me on as if some sort of witch doctor b-grade movie was unfolding before them! Just when I thought that things couldn''t get any worse, the magpie came back for a second attack. This time however, it swooped down on my face and pecked out one of my eyeballs. Fortunately for me, my other eye was still intact so I managed to escape with only minor disfigurement.</p>
<p>A few months after this incident had taken place, some loony bloke called me up claiming that he could lead me to the nest where the bird had come from. I laughed at him at first - but eventually got curious enough to go along with him anyway. Well let me tell you something kiddies - judging by all of the eggs in that nest, there must have been at LEAST ten thousand maggies running around out there! Something had to be done about this! I went back into the wilderness that very same night and hunted down every last one of those vile creatures. Finally, all was quiet again in my neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Still not sure what to do if a magpie attacks you? Maybe these pictures will sway your opinion:</p>

<p>1. Magenta is the perfect balance between red and violet, which makes it a great way to increase energy or relax after a stressful day at work</p>
<p>2. People who wear clothes in this color tend to be more extroverted than people who don''t (although they might not know why!)</p>

<p>5. When exposed to a magenta light, the brain responds by releasing a chemical that stimulates your memory and creative thinking skills!</p>
<p>6. This color is used in many creative industries, including fashion design and interior design - which could have an effect on mood as well as productivity!</p>
<p>7. Magenta can also help relieve stress from electronic devices such as phones and computers - this is because the color acts as a natural anti-inflammatory agent.</p>

(2, 'The downside of magpie taxidermy', '<p>The downside of magpie taxidermy is that it can be difficult to find the right parts. There are plenty of dead animals out there, but not all of them make good additions to your home decor. It&rsquo;s important to know what you want beforehand and then search for it specifically. For example, if you like the look of a deer head mounted on your wall, don&rsquo;t go around looking for anything with antlers because odds are nothing will work out; you should only be searching for deer heads in order to get what you want. The best way to do this is by finding pictures online or in magazines and taking note of where they came from so that when the time comes, hopefully sooner than later, you will have an easier time finding dead animals to suit your needs.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found the parts that you want, it&rsquo;s also good to know when is the best time in which to bring home your latest additions. Certain seasons are better than others when it comes to hunting for certain animal parts; once again, taking note of when these times occur is vital when hunting down dead animals. For example, even though you might find several deer heads in the summer, there is a much greater chance of finding buck heads in the fall. The same can be said about foxes or rabbits etc.; just Google search &ldquo;when to hunt for [insert animal here] heads&rdquo; and you should get some pretty accurate results depending on where you&rsquo;re located.</p>
<p>The best time to go out and find something, dead or alive, is during the night or early morning hours. Generally speaking this is when most animals are on the move so you increase your chances of finding something by being out at these times of day. If possible try not to have anything scheduled for after 9 pm so that you can enjoy some good old-fashioned nightime hunting; if you do go out before sunset it&rsquo;s always a good idea to take a headlamp with you because nothing ruins a good walk like getting caught in the dark and having no way of seeing where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>A final concern would be how much money one should spend on taxidermy. No matter what you like or what your tastes are, it&rsquo;s never easy to drop a couple hundred bucks on something without knowing how long it will last; this is where building up an emergency fund comes in handy. Try not to overspend because if you do and end up hating whatever it is that you get, you&rsquo;ll be stuck with it for the rest of your life which could result in unwanted frustration. If needed, try taking out a little bit of cash every week until you reach whatever amount seems right for whatever type of animal part that you want. It might seem like too much at first but when compared to the joy that comes from finally bringing home your latest addition then I think any minor inconveniences are worth getting there faster.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;art&rsquo; of magpie taxidermy may seem like it can be difficult at first but when broken down into simple steps it becomes something that anybody can do. All that is needed are the right parts, the right tools, and a little bit of patience. Once these things have been found then you should go out there and find yourself some dead animals! Good luck to all who partake in this rewarding hobby!</p>', 5, datetime('2021-11-05 06:21:24'), 'The downside of magpie taxidermy.jpg'),

(1, 'Why magenta is the perfect color for your logo', '<p>It&rsquo;s the color of royalty! It has a strong history in art and design. And it can be used to make your logo pop. So why is magenta still not as popular as blue?</p>
<p>Magenta is an amazing color with lots of benefits, but unfortunately there are some misconceptions about its meaning that keep people from using it more often. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what those myths are and how you can overcome them to use the power of magenta for good!</p>
<p><strong>Myth #1: Magenta is just pink</strong></p>
<p>Nope! True magenta is a strong, vibrant color that has blue undertones. It&rsquo;s the perfect middle ground between cool blue and warm red. Like this lovely color swatch from Color Wheel Pro .</p>
<p>And if you use pure magenta it will end up looking like an intense red on your website or in print. There is nothing wrong with using red in your logo design. But you can make it more unique by adding a little bit of magenta to create something fresh and unexpected.</p>
<p><strong>Myth #2: Magenta is too girly</strong></p>
<p>OK, so this myth really depends on how you are using the color...if there are multiple used in your logo design, and they are all the soft shades of pink, you could be unintentionally creating a feminine look.</p>
<p>But if you use a stronger magenta as one of your main colors for your logo design it will project strength and confidence. And that is a very manly thing to do! So this myth can be put to rest with just a little bit of color theory knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Myth #3: Magenta has no meaning</strong></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t true either! The strong shade of magenta was named after Magnesia , an ancient region in Greece known for its rich deposits of the mineral porcelain clay called &ldquo;Magnesian Chalk&rdquo; which was used as pigment by painters for thousands of years. In fact, the first recorded use of magenta as a color name in English was back in 1859 A.D., according to Dictionary.com , making it one of the newest color terms on their list!</p>
<p>Now that you know some of the history of this vibrant hue, here are two examples where magenta has been used for some awesome logo designs:</p>

(2, 'Magpies in the media', '<p>The Australian magpie is commonly found in around 80-90% of the continent. They are known to be territorial birds and are found in both rural and urban areas. The black and white bird with a red beak is not only seen throughout the country but also found in media all over the world. The Australian magpie has been featured in movies, cartoons, games, songs, artwork, tattoos, TV commercials, books, magazines and even tattoos - to name a few examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Australian magpie is commonly displayed in different styles of artwork, but one frequently appearing design is the tattoo of the bird flying with another creature (usually a kangaroo, emu etc) in its claws. This design can be seen all around the world and it''s often mistakenly believed that this design has some sort of tribal significance, but it doesn''t. It dates back to at least the early 19th century when bushmen would paint these symbols on their bodies to show what they''ve hunted or found during a trip into the wilderness. The designs were usually exaggerated as this helped identify them from a distance. In some cases these drawings also included small human figures, lizards or flowers - each had a meaning too which told something about the person. The bird with prey design was used to show that they were adept hunters and skilled at snaring their prey. Brumbies (wild horses) are sometimes seen instead of kangaroo''s in these drawings, as the horse is an introduced species in Australia. This "bush tat" was also popular for a time among prisoners; especially those who had spent some time out bush where they lived off the land with minimal supplies. As thousands of convicts were sent to Australia during early colonial days it made sense that many would have created these images on their bodies to convey what sort of life they used to live or how well adapted they were to this wild country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Australian magpie tattoo has never had any tribal meaning attached to it, nor is the bird considered to be sacred or significant in any way. This tattoo design is purely based on widespread pop culture imagery which has been used for decades. The image dates back to at least the 1930s when it was seen on postcards and was also printed on hats during this era too. The magpie''s popularity continued through to the 1950s and 1960s when they were seen all over TV shows, movies, comics - even blatantly racist images of "Minstrel Shows" also featured them. You can see one such hideous portrayal below (please don''t laugh at the black face!) that came via US TV show Amos &amp; Andy - a popular sitcom from 1953-1956.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australian magpie tattoos are commonly seen on the arms and legs of both men and women. It is not unusual to see them tattooed all over a person, as they can be placed in any position like other animal designs. This bird sits beautifully for a shoulder piece and can also suit many different body parts (front and back pieces etc) . Their popularity has now spread to Europe too, where several countries have now adopted this iconic Australian image as their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The magpie is mostly seen with its head turned backwards like it''s about to say "cheerio" - but there are some artists who prefer illustrating it as if it''s staring at you or everyone else around you. A lot of contemporary artists will reduce the black details in the wings which means that the design appears lighter and more subtle, while some go to the other extreme and feature it in black &amp; white or sepia. There''s not one particular way of depicting this bird and there is still a lot room for creativity when it comes to how it should look - but most stick with what feels right and won''t alter the design too much from its original form, as that defeats the purpose of why someone would get such a tattoo in the first place!</p>', 3, datetime('2021-11-05 06:35:45'), 'Magpies in the media.jpg'),

(1, 'What does it mean when someone is wearing magenta?', '<p>The color magenta is a mixture of red and violet. It has the same hue as rose, but with less saturation. The name comes from the Latin "magenta" meaning either "dark purple" or "brilliant scarlet". Magenta was first introduced commercially in 1859 by two French chemists who had discovered that mixing aniline dye with sulfuric acid, potassium bichromate, and water produces a substance which colors cloth deep purple-red. This process was popularized under the names ''aniline black'' or ''fuchsine''. But it wasn''t until 1908 when magenta became widely used for its modern purpose of printing colored images on paper after being patented by George Rudge who originally sold magenta-colored socks.</p>
<p>So if someone is wearing magenta, what does that mean? As stated above, the color magenta is a mixture of red and violet. It has the same hue as rose, but with less saturation. When one wears magenta it simply means they are wearing an article of clothing which contains this particular color. That''s pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>Where did tumblr get off claiming if you wear magenta clothes you are gay ?</p>
<p>What an odd generalization to make... Like many other generalizations posted by tumblr users about colors (i.e black being evil), it lacks concrete evidence, therefore cannot be true; unless you''re making some sort of subliminal message out of your fashion choice? Here''s some evidence from the web on why magenta is not a homosexual color:</p>
<p>In fashion, wearing pink means you''re gay. In fashion, wearing anything that isn''t black or grey means you''re gay. In fashion, being visible and having a pulse means you''re gay.</p>
<p>For men who want to avoid this fashion rule &ndash; assume it''s true &ndash; there are several ways around it &ndash; for instance, green &ndash; which is also considered a feminine colour for guys if your wardrobe consists of pink shirts and green pants, then all I can say is good luck with that whole straight thing&hellip;" -Rennie Dyball</p>
<p>Wearing Magenta Doesn''t Make You Gay... Wearing Anything That Isn''t Black Or Grey Does... by snickerpants</p>
<p>So if you wear magenta clothes or any other color, relax. You might just be expressing yourself by wearing the color of your choice. Personally I think wearing pink (for guys) would look pretty good on some people... but that''s just me :)</p>

(2, 'Why Magpies are Popular in Fairy Tales', '<p>Magpies are mid-sized songbirds with black and white plumage. The head, neck, tail, wings and back are black while the rest of their body is white. This combination gives them an appearance that makes them look like they are wearing a tuxedo, making them very popular in films, films and paintings. It is said that the dark spots on their white plumage are reminiscent of eyes, so they have been linked to the notion of magic and mystery throughout history.</p>
<p>The English word magpie comes from the Latin "pica", which itself comes from the earlier Greek &pi;?&sigma;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf; piskos, meaning ''seed-eating bird''. The magpie is therefore not a bird native to Great Britain but has occupied the role of a pest that steals small shiny things from everyone here. In China, however, it is considered a good omen because its white colour symbolizes joy and gratitude.</p>
<p>The collective noun for a group of magpies is a "murder" of magpies.</p>
<p><strong>What roles do they play in fairy tales?</strong></p>
<p>Magpies are extremely popular birds that have appeared in countless stories, legends and superstitions since ancient times. They are typically portrayed as intelligent birds that could understand human speech, but they were also linked to omens of death.</p>
<p>A tale by the Brothers Grimm tells about a vain and foolish young man who wants to impress his lover with tricks that he learned from magpies. Magpies had been known for many years through tales like this one, which made them some of the most famous birds in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Superstitions about magpies are very varied across different European countries, but they usually range from good luck to bad luck depending on actions that people took with regard to them. Magpies were sometimes described as thieves who liked shiny objects like jewellery, so it is perhaps not surprising that these birds inspired many fairy tales.</p>
<p><strong>How are they related to the crows?</strong></p>
<p>Magpies and crows belong to the order of Corvus birds, which also includes jays, ravens and jackdaws. The magpie is often confused with a crow or even a raven because these species are very similar in appearance. In general, however, magpies tend to be shinier and have longer tails than other corvid species.</p>
<p><strong>Are there similar species of birds?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of birds have black and white plumage that makes them look similar to magpies. Examples include the grackle, jaybird, myna bird, jackdaw and rook.</p>
<p>There are around 120 known species in the Corvidae family. This figure includes Hawaiian crows and ground-living crows that live on Fiji and other Pacific islands. These birds are generally smaller than most corvids, but they share a very similar appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Magpies are a popular bird in fairy tales and stories because of their black and white plumage. They were seen as intelligent birds who could understand human speech or omens of death depending on the story. Magpie superstitions vary across different European countries, but they''re mostly considered good luck if you harm them with bad luck coming to those that tease them for being thieves by stealing shiny objects like jewels.</p>
<p>If you find yourself surrounded by magpies, it''s best not to go near them! You''ll also be interested to know that there is no such thing as an English magpie - these corvids originated from China and migrated over through Europe centuries ago where they became pests!</p>', 4, datetime('2021-05-21 07:46:02'), 'Why-Magpies-are-Popular-in-Fairy-Tales.jpg'),
